# SpiderData
A multi-platform, multi-access database of all your files.
This file will be updated in mostly kinda plain English so a normal human with shit to do can read it and get on with their lives.
Though I count it as a personal failure if anyone NEEDS to RTFM to use the program.

PURPOSE:
This program has the following capabilities as core features:
  1. INDEXING: The program must be capable of indexing all files in selected branches.
  2. SORTING:  The program must be capable of sorting and displaying all files in the database together in one place.
  3. DATABASE: The program must use a separate plaintext database for reference.

Secondary features to include:
  A. COMPATIBILITY: The software should be developed from the start to be capable of indexing data from as many sources as possible.
  B. INTEROPERABILITY: The software should be capable of accessing and indexing all cloud storage platforms.
  C. UNIQUE ID'S: The software should be capable of using photos or other user-provided graphics files to represent the drives.
  
Tertiary goals:[it would be nice if....]
  a. There could be proportionate graphical representations of files [SEE: WinDirStat; SGI File System Navigator(kinda)]
  b. coded as low-level as possible; Assembly would be nice, but gimme a break....a CLOUD interface with the Google API would be ridiculous in ASM,
  to say nothing about iCloud....So I'm thinking C or maybe even Java but NO AutoIT, Lua, Visual BASIC.....you get the Idea....
  c. The interface could be customizable a-la Photoshop or IDA, but by default I'd like it to be as simple as possible.
  
  MORE TO COME
